In C++, loops are fundamental programming constructs that allow executing a block of code repeatedly based on specified conditions. The "for" loop is ideal for iterating a fixed number of times, initializing variables, and testing conditions. The "while" loop continues as long as a specified condition remains true. The "do-while" loop guarantees at least one execution before checking the condition. Loops are versatile and widely used for automating tasks, processing arrays, and handling complex iterations efficiently. They enable programmers to control program flow, optimize algorithms, and implement iterative solutions. With loops, C++ programs can handle repetitive tasks seamlessly, making them an essential feature in modern programming and enhancing code readability and maintainability.
